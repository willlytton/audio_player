# Desktop App Spotify/Apple/Audio File Player

This application is a work in progress any and all properties are subject to change..

Remember when you used to click an audio file on your computer and the old Windows XP default audio player would play the file regardless if it was an mp3 file or some other type of audio file. Well this is what I am attempting to create with this application. 

As a way of completing my goal of developing a fullstack application by the end of 2023, I've attempted to create something that I use pretty much everyday...A dreaded spotify clone...DUN DUN DUNNNN....

To being this I started with looking up the stack spotify uses for its web application which is I believe for the in browser app it is using React for the front end. For the backend, which I couldn't dream of ever being competent enough to understand is dozens upon dozens of Java microservices combined together to give you the spotify application which millions of users love and enjoy.


## FIGMA UI Design

Using Figma I thought I'd try for once to use my trust dusty art background and design a UI for this application. I'm sort of winging it at this point but I believe by doing this its allowing to slow down and develop a pipeline for getting things done as to not be overwhelmed by the scope of this thing. 

I took ideas from both the Apple Music and Spotify app as far as inspiration. During this I sort of had the idea to just make a mobile app but I really wanted to keep this as a JS/TS app. Maybe one day I will learn React Native...

The great thing about Figma is I am able to think about my Design components like I would React components which in terms of common practices has been sort of a struggle for me.
